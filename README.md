# TB Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Project Overview
This project aims to automate the screening and identification of tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques, with a focus on different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture i.e. Resnet, VGG19, and Inception. We explore these various CNN architectures to improve the accuracy and efficiency of TB detection, comparing our results to traditional radiologist interpretations.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x 
- OpenCV for image processing
- Various CNN architectures (ResNet, Inception, VGG)

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone this repository `https://github.com/mirugwe1/TB_AI_screening.git` and install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
